# Lore
Rome has fallen.
 
Man has been cast into an age of darkness. Amidst the rubble, a city of people fight for survival against the constant threat of rogue militias and desperate despots, looking to salvage what is left of a once great Empire. Join the cause for peace and defend the city, or risk life and limb exploring the surrounding wilderness. Dark Realms: City of Syne is a fantasy world designed to allow players to form their own government, and to work with or against each other for ultimate control of the Realm.
